# XFlow Tutorial Guide: How to Create and Run Workflows
 
XFlow is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for creating and running workflows. A workflow is a sequence of steps that perform a specific task or process. With XFlow, you can design workflows using a graphical interface, execute them on the cloud or on-premise, and monitor their progress and results.

In this tutorial guide, we will show you how to create and run a simple workflow using XFlow. You will learn how to:
 
- Create a new project and workflow
- Add and configure workflow steps
- Connect workflow steps with data flows
- Run and test the workflow
- View the workflow logs and results

Let's get started!
  
## Create a new project and workflow
 
To create a new project and workflow in XFlow, follow these steps:

1. Open XFlow in your browser and log in with your credentials.
2. Click on the **New Project** button on the top right corner of the dashboard.
3. Enter a name and description for your project and click **Create**.
4. Click on the **New Workflow** button on the top right corner of the project page.
5. Enter a name and description for your workflow and click **Create**.
6. You will see a blank canvas where you can design your workflow.

## Add and configure workflow steps
 
A workflow step is a unit of work that performs a specific action or function. XFlow provides a library of predefined steps that you can use in your workflows, such as data processing, machine learning, web scraping, email sending, etc. You can also create your own custom steps using Python code.
 
To add and configure workflow steps in XFlow, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Steps** tab on the left sidebar to open the step library.
2. Drag and drop the steps that you want to use in your workflow from the library to the canvas.
3. Click on each step to open its configuration panel on the right sidebar.
4. Enter the required parameters and settings for each step. You can also rename the step or add a description if you want.
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

## Connect workflow steps with data flows
 
A data flow is a connection between two workflow steps that transfers data from one step to another. Data flows are represented by arrows on the canvas. You can create data flows by dragging from the output port of one step to the input port of another step. You can also edit or delete data flows by clicking on them.
 
To connect workflow steps with data flows in XFlow, follow these steps:

1. Drag from the output port of one step to the input port of another step to create a data flow.
2. A dialog box will appear where you can select the type and format of the data that you want to transfer.
3. Select the appropriate options and click **Create**.
4. You will see an arrow connecting the two steps on the canvas.
5. You can click on the arrow to edit or delete the data flow if needed.

## Run and test the workflow
 
To run and test the workflow in XFlow, follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Run** button on the top right corner of the canvas.
2. A dialog box will appear where you can select the execution mode and environment for your workflow. You can choose to run your workflow on the cloud or on-premise, and select the number of workers and memory size for your execution.
3. Select the appropriate options and click **Run**.
4. You will see a notification that your workflow has been submitted for execution.
5. You can click on the **Monitor** tab on the left sidebar to view the status and progress of your workflow execution.
